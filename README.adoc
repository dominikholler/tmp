oVirt external network provider for OVN
=======================================

The oVirt external network provider for OVN allows to integrate oVirt with the
Open vSwitch Open Virtual Network (OVN) solution. OVN is a Software Defined
Networking extension to Open vSwitch. OVN is integrated into oVirt using
oVirt's external network API, which is a subset of the OpenStack Networking API
v2.0 and the OpenStack Identity API v2.0. The oVirt provider for OVN serves as
a proxy between oVirt engine and OVN  Northbound  Database.
This role is called a "Cloud Management System (CMS) Plugin" in the OVN
documentation.

Configuration
-------------
The configuration of the ovirt-provider-ovn service is read from
`/etc/ovirt-provider-ovn/ovirt-provider-ovn.conf` and
`/etc/ovirt-provider-ovn/conf.d/*.conf`, where files are sorted by name, last
wins.
If a value is not set in one of the configuration files, an internal hardcoded
value is used, which is called _default_ here.

The configuration files consist of key value pairs, which are structured by
named sections. Sections headings are marked with square brackets.
The configuration files are read with python's ConfigParser, so documentation
about the ConfigParser's accepted syntax can be applied.
used.

A complete configuration can be generated by oVirt engine-setup.

### Section [OVN REMOTE]
This section defines which OVN Northbound Database is used.

ovn-remote:: The address used to connect to the OVN Northbound Database server. +
  The address is expected in the following format: +
  `[tcp|ssl]:<ovn central ip>:<north db port, 6641 by default>` +
  _default:_ `tcp:127.0.0.1:6641`

### Section [DHCP]
If subnets are defined, OVN will provide an internal DHCP server.
See documentation of OVN Northbound Database for more details.

dhcp-server-mac:: The MAC address of the internal DHCP server. +
  _default:_ `02:00:00:00:00:00`

dhcp-lease-time:: The offered DHCP lease time in seconds. +
  _default:_ `86400`

dhcp-enable-mtu:: Enables setting the MTU by the internal DHCP server. +
  The default value may be changed in future versions. +
  _default:_ `true`

dhcp-mtu:: The offered MTU. +
 The tunneling adds additional encapsulation headers to the tunneled data.
 In default configuration OVN does not set the Donâ€™t Fragment bit, see
 `df_default` in
 link:http://openvswitch.org/support/dist-docs/ovs-vswitchd.conf.db.5.html[ovs-vswitchd.conf.db(5)].
 For this reason the offert MTU plus the additional encapsulation headers
 length must not be larger than the MTU of the tunneling network.
 For an encapsulation in Geneve, UDP, IPv4 and Ethernet without 802.1Q are
 58 bytes added. If the tunneling network has a MTU of 1500, this results to a
 MTU of 1442 for the tunneld network. +
 _default:_ `1442`

### Section [SSL]
TLS may be used to secure the communication to the OVN Northbound Database and
on oVirt's external network API.

https-enabled:: Enables HTTPS/TLS for oVirt's external network API. +
  _default:_ `false`

ssl-key-file:: Path of the private key file. +
  _default:_ `/etc/pki/ovirt-engine/keys/ovirt-provider-ovn.key.nopass`

ssl-cert-file:: Path of the certificate associated with the private key file. +
  _default:_ `/etc/pki/ovirt-engine/certs/ovirt-provider-ovn.cer`

ssl-cacert-file:: Path to the certificate authority's certificate used to
  validate the OVN Northbound Database's identity. +
  _default:_ `/etc/pki/ovirt-engine/ca.pem`

### Section [AUTH]
Authorization and authentication of requests to the external network API are
handled by a plugin. Multiple implementations of the plugin are available.
Currently two authentication plugins are supported:

*  AuthorizationByUserName - oVirt engine's SSO generates a token, which must be
   used to validate subsequent requests to the oVirt's external network API.
   The plugin AuthorizationByUserName uses oVirt engine's SSO to create a token
   from the given username and password. The user has to be a
   valid user of oVirt engine. The token in the requests to the oVirt's
   external network API is authorized, if it is associated to the username
   defined in the provider's configuration. This plugin is the _default_,
   because after the installation of oVirt only the default user
   "admin@internal", but no groups, may be available.

*  AuthorizationByGroup - oVirt engine's SSO generates a token, which must be
   used to validate subsequent requests to the oVirt's external network API.
   The plugin AuthorizationByUserName uses oVirt engine's SSO to create a token
   from the given username and password. The user has to be a
   valid user of oVirt engine. The token in the requests to the oVirt's
   external network API is authorized, if it is associated to
   a user which is a member of the group defined in the provider's configuration.
   In the configuration file in the section `[OVIRT]`, the option
   `ovirt-admin-group-atrribute-name` defines the name of the attribute in the
   directory server holding the group name. The option
   `ovirt-admin-group-attribute-value` defines the name of the group, which grants
   authorization to it's members. The default configuration is to authorize
   members of the group `NetAdmin` in the default extension
   `ovirt-engine-extension-aaa-jdbc`. If oVirt engine uses an external LDAP
   provider for authentification, `ovirt-admin-group-attribute-value` has to be
   adopted in the ovn-provider's configuration.

<<user-names-for-authentication>> gives more details about the expected format of
the user name.

Other plugins exists, but they are not supported:

*  NoAuthPlugin - generates a static token, independently from the provided
   username and password, and accepts every request to oVirt's external network API.
   Even requests, which do not contain the `X-Auth-Token` HTTP header are
   accepted.

*  MagicTokenPlugin - generates a static token, independently from the provided
   username and password. Request to oVirt's external network API must provide this
   static token.

*  AuthorizationByRole - uses the oVirt engine's SSO to
   create a token from the given username and password. The token in the
   requests to oVirt's external network API is authorized, if it is associated to
   a user with the role defined in the provider's configuration.

//-

It is also possible to use a custom authentication plugin implementation
and use it here. `provider/auth/plugin.py` defines the interface every
authentication plugin has to implement.


auth-plugin:: Plugin to use for authorization and authentication.
  The plugin is expected in the following format: +
  `python_module_name:class_name` +
  _default:_ `auth.plugins.ovirt:AuthorizationByUserName`

### Section [OVIRT]
This section provides information used by the ovirt authentication plugins.

ovirt-host:: URL scheme and host of ovirt-engine. Used by all auth-plugins from
  `auth.plugins.ovirt`. +
  The following format is expected: `https://host[:port]` +
  _default:_ `https://engine-host`

ovirt-base:: Base path of ovirt-engine relative to `ovirt-host`. +
  _default:_ `/ovirt-engine`

ovirt-ca-file:: Path to the certificate authority's certificate to validate
  the engine's identity. +
  _default:_ `/etc/pki/ovirt-engine/ca.pem`

ovirt-auth-timeout:: This value is used as connection and read timeout during
  communication with the engine. +
  _default:_ `110`

ovirt-sso-client-id:: Only registered clients can connect to engine's SSO.
  This value is the id of the client as registered in the engine's SSO.
  engine-setup or ovirt-register-sso-client can be used to register the
  external network provider. +
  _default:_ `ovirt-provider-ovn`

ovirt-sso-client-secret:: The password required to connect using the client-id
  specified in the previous property. The ovirt-sso-client-secret is provided
  after registration at engine's SSO. +
  _default:_ `to_be_set`

ovirt-admin-user-name:: The name of the user allowed to access the external
  network API by the AuthorizationByUserName plugin. +
  <<user-names-for-authentication>> gives more details about the expected format of
the user name. +
  _default:_ `admin@internal`

ovirt-admin-role-id:: Users having this role, are allowed to access the
   external network API by the AuthorizationByRole plugin. +
  _default:_ `def00005-0000-0000-0000-def000000005`, maps to the role
  "NetworkAdmin"

ovirt-admin-group-attribute-name:: The AuthorizationByGroup plugin allows
  members of a given group access to the external network API. This option
  defines the name of the attribute in the directory server which holds the
  group name. The default value must not changed, if the
  ovirt-engine-extension-aaa-jdbc is used. +
  _default:_ `AAA_AUTHZ_GROUP_NAME;java.lang.String;0eebe54f-b429-44f3-aa80-4704cbb16835`

ovirt-admin-group-attribute-value:: The name of the group allowed to access the
  external network API. +
  _default:_ `NetAdmin`

### User Names for Authentication
The three plugins for authorization and authentication by oVirt
(AuthorizationByUserName, AuthorizationByGroup and AuthorizationByRole)
require that a user name to access the oVirt external network provider for
OVN from an Cloud Management System (e.g. as an external
network provider in oVirt). The name has to match the following format:
`<admin_username>[@<fqdn>]@<ovirt_profile>`, while the optional `<fqdn>` is
the Active Directory or LDAP domain. Please find more details in
http://ovirt.github.io/ovirt-engine-api-model/master/#types/user/attributes/user_name[oVirt's REST API documentation about `user_name`]
