:toc:

:sectnums:

The oVirt external network provider for OVN (ovirt-provider-ovn) allows to
integrate oVirt with the Open Virtual Network (OVN) solution.

OVN is integrated into oVirt using oVirtâ€™s external network API, which is a
subset of the link:https://developer.openstack.org/api-ref/network/v2[OpenStack Networking API v2.0]
and the OpenStack Identity API v2.0.

It fulfills the CMS (*cloud management system*) role in the OVN architecture,
defined in link:http://www.openvswitch.org/support/dist-docs/ovn-architecture.7.html[ovn-architecture].

## Use Cases

### Isolated overlay Networks

ovirt-provider-ovn enables VM administrators, to provide VMs with virtual,
isolated OSI layer 2 networks, without needing changes to the physical network
device configuration.
The networks can be customized according to a variety of parameters - MTU, and
MAC spoofing protection, etc.
These networks can also work at OSI layer 3, supporting features such as:
 - IPAM
 - dhcp
 - routing
 - security groups

### Physical Networks

It is possible to connect the OVN logical networks to a physical network,
akin to OpenStack's link:https://ovirt.org/develop/release-management/features/network/provider-physical-network.html[physnet].
The traffic on the physical external network can optionally be VLAN tagged.
Connecting to external networks is **limited** to oVirt clusters configured to
use *Open vSwitch* switch type, which is currently in tech-preview.

## Implemented Subset of the Networking API

This section lists all API features implemented by ovirt-provider-ovn

The presence of an attribute not listed below will result in
Bad Request response (HTTP 400 status code) in case of the following API methods:
 - update subnet,
 - create/update Security group rules
 - create/update Security groups methods

For all other methods, the attributes will simply be ignored.

### Filtering
The filter extension has been implemented for all the subsequent resources,
meaning that the following examples are possible:

- GET /v2.0/networks?name=<network_name>
- GET /v2.0/networks?name=<network_name>?limit=10

### Limitations
The following features are not implemented:

- SNAT and DNAT
- floating IPs
- load balancing
- the tag extension.

#### Networking API deviations
Remember that the overall goal of the ovirt-provider-api is to integrate
ovirt-engine with OVN. Also remember that oVirt is a virtualization solution,
pre-dating the cloud era - as such, it misses the 'tenant' / 'project' concept.

To keep the API consistent, the networking API elements do return / accept
tenant and project information, but, those are not processed, and are usually
hardcoded.

#### Network to Subnet association
For simplicity sake, ovirt-provider-ovn imposes a one to one network to subnet
association - meaning one network can have **at most** one subnet.

This leads to some interesting side-effects: since IPv6 / IPv4 choice is
defined at subnet level, if the user wants to have an IPv4 address *and* an
IPv6 address in the same VM, he/she has to do so by using 2 different ports -
each port attached to a network that has a subnet on top.

#### Single IP Address per port
Orthogonally to the limitation decribed <<network-to-subnet-association,above>>,
but for the exact same reason (keeping things simple), ovirt-provider-ovn
limits each port to feature a single IP address.

## Implemented Subset of the Identity API
The ovirt-provider-ovn implements the minimal subset of the Identity API v2.0.
Upgrading to v3 is not part of the current roadmap.
Please find below the implemented URLs and the inputs they accept:

GET /v2.0/tenants :: No inputs.

POST /v2.0/tokens ::

|username            | See "User Names for Authentication" in
                       link:../README.adoc#user-names-for-authentication[README]
|password            | The password for the user
|token               | If no passwordCrendentials is provided, the token is validated.
|=========================================================

GET /v2.0 :: No inputs.

## Accessing ovirt-provider-ovn

Simple management of <<networks,networks>> and <<subnets,subnets>> can be done via
oVirt's Administration Portal.

In addition to <<networks,networks>> and <<subnets,subnets>>,
link:http://manageiq.org/[ManageIQ] and
link:https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/management/cloudforms[Red Hat CloudsForms]
enable the usage of <<routers,routers>>.

All features implemented by ovirt-provider-ovn, including <<security,security groups>>,
are known to work with the the
link:https://github.com/ansible/ansible/tree/devel/lib/ansible/modules/cloud/openstack[OpenStack modules]
of Ansible and the
link:https://docs.openstack.org/python-openstackclient/latest/[command-line client for OpenStack (OpenStackClient)].

Ansible and the command-line client can be
link:https://docs.openstack.org/python-openstackclient/latest/configuration/[configured]
by by the environment variables:
```
unset OS_SERVICE_TOKEN
export OS_USERNAME=admin@internal
export OS_PASSWORD='123456'
export OS_AUTH_URL=https://localhost:35357/v2.0
export OS_CACERT=/etc/pki/ovirt-engine/ca.pem

```
or clouds.yml:
```
clouds:
  ovirt:
    auth:
      auth_url: https://0.0.0.0:35357/v2.0
      password: '123456'
      username: admin@internal
    verify: false
```
